Arvind Kumar 04 February, 2023 Chapter 1 Welcome 1.1 Motivation The motivation for writing this book is very simple : I wish it had existed when I was in grad school and slogging through semester-long courses on transportation systems planning &amp; economics. This book is a work in progress. 1.2 Intended Audience The intended audience for this book is grad students who have recently joined a master’s program in transportation engineering and/or planning in the Indian subcontinent. Given the intended audience, I have made the following assumptions : You already have a working knowledge of basic statistics &amp; probability You are willing to learn more about econometrics &amp; graph theory You want to code your way through your program 1.3 Logistics This book borrows heavily from a lot of great tutorials and resources – there are links throughout, like these : (ONR | YouTube) Statistics @ Khan Academy (ONR | YouTube) Statistics @ Khan Academy (ONR | Book) Introduction to Data Science, by Neth (2022) (ONR | Book) R for Data Science, by Wickham &amp; Grolemund (2016) (ONR | Book) Tidy Modelling with R, by Kuhn &amp; Silge (2022) All online resources - ONR - linked in this tutorial are free forever (including this tutorial). Sadly, the same cannot be said about the offline resources - OFR - (textbooks, research papers, etc.) - you are welcome to explore your university’s library. If you have to spend money, then compare prices here first. If you’d like to give back, please consider making a donation to - Chief Minister’s Relief Fund, Odisha. Odisha is one of the most disaster-prone states in India; &gt;100 cyclones/typhoons in the last 2 centuries : (1) (2) (3). 1.4 Next Steps This book is primarily intended to be used as a self-learning resource. The best way to learn is to follow along with your own computer. Before you begin, please do the following : Install R Install RStudio Create a dedicated folder to save your work (this should not be located in your C: drive) 1.5 Caveat Emptor I like learning the theoretical minimum to get started on any given topic, instead of aiming for perfection. I don’t care about marks/grades. The book reflects this style. If you need help in understanding theory, reach out to your course TAs and/or Profs. 1.6 Learning to Learn Academia is a horribly messed up place to learn/live/work. If you struggle with : Reading, then : Read (OFR | Book) How to Read a Book, by Adler &amp; Van Doren (1940) If you think asking someone to read a book if they want to learn how to read a book, is slightly ironical, then read (ONR | Series of Articles) How to Read A Book, by Farnam Street Writing, then : First, work on your English grammar (choose a book appropriate to your level) (OFR | Book) Essential English Grammar, by Murphy (2000) (OFR | Book) Intermediate English Grammar, by Murphy (1999) (OFR | Book) Advanced English Grammar, by Hewings (1999) And then, read the following books by William Zinsser : (OFR | Book) On Writing Well (OFR | Book) Writing to Learn Finally, get started on writing in English for academia : (OFR | Book) A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, by Turabian (7Ed) (OFR | Book) The Craft of Research, by Booth (3Ed) Motivation, then, read : (OFR | Book) Drive, by Pink (2009) (OFR | Book) Scarcity, by Mullainathan &amp; Shafir (2013) 1.7 About Me I am a civil engineer who designs highways. When I’m not designing highways, I find myself reading non-fiction books on India, Psychology and History of Geometry &amp; Forecasting, or eating biryani. Cats Rule !!!
